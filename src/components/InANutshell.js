            <p className="text">I came to coding as a result of a brief class that one of my friends was offering. It was only a five day class where we tackled problem solving using JavaScript. It was fun, engaging, and spoke to my own problem solving process. Taking a problem, story, or need apart and developing the building blocks of the journey or solution has always fascinated me. With this small taste of the power of coding, I was hooked.</p>

            <p className="text">In addition to the appeal of the problem solving aspects of coding, I’ve seen the incredible impact the web has had on my students and their sense of belonging and community. The web allows groups that have felt marginalized an opportunity to belong to and develop a larger community beyond the limits of their geography.</p>

            <p className="text">Building to connect people and encourage understanding through an art of problem solving and logic, is an ideal career for me. Personally, I love exploring the new ways people are interacting. With the growth of voice interaction and the melding of virtual and augmented realities, I feel we’re on the greatest step in human and computer interaction since the mouse was invented. I am thrilled to be engaged in and a part of this industry.</p>
